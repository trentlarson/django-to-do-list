My first Django project: managing a to-do list, stored in a browser cookie

Notes
- For production project, I would have started with test scripts.
  (Selenium in this case... it's not to the level of unit tests yet.)
- no server-side persistence (no item IDs, etc)
- no cookie format checking

To Do
- testing
- edit items
- true RESTful architecture
- AJAX (no page reloads)
- drag to new position
